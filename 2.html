  <p> Henry Clifford, 10th Baron Clifford (c. 1454 – 23 April 1523), was an English nobleman. Henry's father died fighting for the House of Lancaster, and when Henry Tudor came to the throne in 1485, he relied on Clifford as a loyal Tudor servant to control the north of England. Clifford was not always successful in this, and his actions were not always popular, but his royal service was extremely profitable. He frequently quarrelled with his neighbours, occasionally resulting in violent feuds. He married a cousin of the King and his infidelity became notorious.
